# Backend ⚙️

## Why? 🤔

Although we believe in keeping our tech stack simple at HaulBuy, the creation of
a separate backend was needed for organization. Choosing Deno was a decision made
due to the fact that Supabase serverless edge functions were built with it, and it
seemed great, just needed more structure.

This format addresses the need for structure, allowing us to better create
certain functionality at HaulBuy that requires more complex permissions, rather than
just inserts, reads, and writes. We strive to be the modern shipping agent, with
a modern tech stack to keep up with modern customer needs.
